            <p>She became a comisssion agent selling products for <strong>Annie Turnbo Malone</strong>, an African American hair-care entrepreneur who would later become and industry rival. She started to develop her own products and business on the side.
              In <strong>1906</strong>, she married a Charles Walker and became known as Madam C. J. Walker and marketed herself as an independent hairdresser and retailer of cosmetic creams. Walker sold her products door to door, teaching other black women other ways of groom and style their hair.
As the business grew, her daughter and husband assumed important roles and progressed it further. To increase her company's sales force, Walker trained other women to become "beauty culturists" using <strong>"The Walker System"</strong>(her own method)
Between 1911 and 1919, during the height of her career, Walker and her company employed several thousand women as sales agents for its products.</p>

            <p>In addition to training in sales and grooming, Walker showed other black women how to budget, build their own business and encouraged them to become financially independent. The result was what is now known as <strong>Madam C. J. Walker Beauty Culturists Union of America.</strong>
She helped raise funds to establish a branch of the YMCA in Indianapolis' black community. Walker also contributed scholarship funds to the Tuskegee Institute as well as other many beneficiaries.
Walker became more involved in political matters after her move to New York. She delivered lectures on political, economic, and social issues at conventions sponsored by powerful black institutions.
              She passed on <strong>May 25, 1919</strong> from kidney failure and complications of hypertension at the age of fifty-one. At the time of her death she was considered to be the wealthiest African American woman in America. Walker's personal papers are preserved at the Indiana Historical Society in Indianapolis.</p>
